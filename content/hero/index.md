I’m a Full Stack Engineer and AI Solutions Architect with experience leading end-to-end development — from idea to infrastructure — across fintech, aviation, logistics and media.  
I combine hands-on engineering with system-level thinking to create ventures that are technically sound, locally relevant, and globally scalable.
