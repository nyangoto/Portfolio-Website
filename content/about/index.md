I’m a Full Stack Software Engineer and Technical Lead focused on building systems that blend intelligent architecture with practical impact.

My work spans AI platforms, scalable cloud apps, and real-time systems—often in high-stakes domains like media, aviation, and fintech. I’ve led teams, shipped production-grade tools, and continuously explore how emerging technologies can solve complex, real-world problems.

Whether it's architecting an AI-powered media intelligence platform or deploying embedded hazard detection systems, I care deeply about clean design, purposeful code, and products that make a difference.

I specialize in building full-stack applications with modern JavaScript and Python frameworks, scalable backends, and robust cloud infrastructure. My recent work has focused on AI/ML-powered systems—from media intelligence platforms to conversational assistants—designed to enhance user experience and solve regionally relevant, real-world problems.
